=================================

Benchmarking the performance of verifying positive definite and positive semidefinite properties of Mueller matrices using Choletsky, Sylvester's criterion, characteristic polynomial, and eigenvalues. This is done using @btime, which can take some time to run.

=================================

The number of non-positive:

- definite matrices (according to Cholesky) is 868
-     (the percentage of non-positive definite matrices is 0.207%.

- definite matrices (according to Sylvester) is 868.

- semi-definite matrices (according to characteristic polynomial) is 868.

- semi-definite matrices (according to eigenvalue computation) is 868

=================================

Checking if the indices of non positive definite (by Cholesky) are the same as the indices of not positive

- semi-definite (according to eigenvalues): true

- definite (Sylvester Criterion): true

- semi-definite (characteristic polynomial): true
